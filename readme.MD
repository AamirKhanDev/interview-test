## Innovate42

Welcome to the Innovate42 coding interview.

### Instructions

Please answer the question below and raise a pull request when done.    

### Overview

The directories contain 3 sample apps.  They are all based on the the tic-tac-toe react tutorial, which you can find at [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html].

The directories are :-


| Directory     | Contents      |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| app-original      | The original app from the tutorial |
| app-standalone      | The same app, but re-written slightly. |
| app-redux  | A redux version of the app    |

### Questions

Please answer the following questions.  ***Examples are good*** 


1.  What is react?   

    Please write a short summary below on what react means to you.  Some thing to consider are:-
    
    * what do you like/dislike about react 
    * why do you think react is different.  
    * How does react compare to other libraries.
    
    -->
    
2.  What challenges have you had in building a react app.  How did you overcome the challenges.

    -->
    
3.  The examples don't use plain js and are using jsx with embedded html tags.  What makes this magic work when running the javascript in a browser.

    -->     
    
4.  Comparing the app-original and app-standalone code bases.   The app-standalone code base has put each component in a separate file and directory structure.   

    Why do you think that was done, what are the advantages/ disadvantages?
    
    -->
    
    The app-standalone has introduced a components and a containers folder.  Based on the examples in each folder, what do you think our definition of component might be ?
    
    -->
    
    And what about a container?
    
    -->
     
5.  What is the react component lifecycle ?

6. Thinking about a production ready app, what do you think is missing from the app-standalone code base ? 

7. Are you familiar with redux ?  If so what is the basic idea behind it ? 



### Coding Challenges

With either the app-standalone or app-redux app (whichever you are more comfortable with), please complete the following changes:-

1. Update the app so that is highlights the winning move.
2. Update the app so that it allows for a named player X and Y, and it keeps a league table of who won each game.
