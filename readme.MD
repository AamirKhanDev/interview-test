## Innovate42

Welcome to the Innovate42 coding interview.

### Instructions

Please answer the question below (just write the answers in the spaces provided). Once the coding examples are done, please either zip up your files and send them to me daniel@innovate42.com.  

We can then discuss the changes that you have made.

### Overview

The directories contain 2 sample apps.  They are  based on the the tic-tac-toe react tutorial, which you can find at [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html].

The directories are :-


| Directory     | Contents      |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| app-original      | The original app from the tutorial |
| app-standalone      | The same app, but re-written slightly. |

### Questions

Please answer the following questions. 


    
1.  Comparing the app-original and app-standalone code bases.   The app-standalone code base has put each component in a separate file and directory structure.   

    Why do you think that was done, what are the advantages/ disadvantages?
    
    --

2. Thinking about a production ready app, what do you think is missing from all the example.  *hint: the square component in the standalone app has one* ?

    -- 

4. Are you familiar with redux ?  If so what is the basic idea behind it ?

    --  



### Coding Challenges

With the app-standalone, please complete the following changes:-

1. Update the app so that is highlights the winning move.
2. Update the app so that it allows for a named player X and Y, and it keeps a league table of who won each game.
3. If you get time, implement something that you think that the app could do and is cool.  What other things would you change.
