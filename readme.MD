## Innovate42

Welcome to the Innovate42 coding interview.

## What we are currently thinking


 * ES6 and ES7 - Lets keep up with new features that help.
 * React with Redux (we like more of the logic in redux (or even better in separate packages), react as the view).
 * Backend - Serverless or Docker/Express. Database mogo or dynamodb
 * Modular  - lets break things into separate modules and publish them separately.
 * Build with Webpack
 * Jest for Unit testing
 * We like the look of Observables, and will experiment with them a bit (and probably adopt).
 

### Instructions

Please answer the question below (just write the answers in the spaces provided). Once the coding examples are done, please either zip up your files and send them to me daniel@innovate42.com.  

We can then discuss the changes that you have made.

### Overview

The directories contain 3 sample apps.  They are  based on the the tic-tac-toe react tutorial, which you can find at [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html].

The directories are :-


| Directory     | Contents      |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| app-original      | The original app from the tutorial |
| app-standalone      | The same app, but re-written slightly. |
| app-redux      | The same app,using redux. |

### Questions

Please answer the following questions. 


    
1.  Comparing the app-original and app-standalone code bases.   The app-standalone code base has put each component in a separate file and directory structure.   

    Why do you think that was done, what are the advantages/ disadvantages?
    
    --

2. Thinking about a production ready app, what do you think is missing from all the example.  *hint: the square component in the standalone app has one* ?

    -- 

3. Are you familiar with redux ?  If so what is the basic idea behind it ?

    --  
    
4. If you are interested in the full-stack role.  Please take a look at the partial implementation of an express routes in backend/router.js.

    * Thinking of a production application, what issues do you see with this code ? 

    --      



### Coding Challenges

With either the  app-standalone or app-redux (**not both** - whichever you are comfortable with), please complete the following changes:-

1. Update the app so that is highlights the winning move.
2. Update the app so that it allows for a named player X and Y, and it keeps a league table of who won each game.
3. If you get time, implement something that you think that the app could do and is cool.  What other things would you change.


### Expectations
 * Don't spend too long on this, although fairly simple it will take some time.  Limit to 1.5 hours -> if you don't finish that is fine.
    * -> Finish what you can well.
 * Some testing, but don't go to town (for this).  But write at least one test case, so that we know you can do it. 
    * The example code doesn't have much testing - and it should.
 * Clean, concise code.  Some comments might be nice.
 * Knowledge of ES6 syntax
